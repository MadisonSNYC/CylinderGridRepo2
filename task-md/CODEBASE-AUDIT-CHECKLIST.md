# üìã CODEBASE AUDIT CHECKLIST - MANDATORY READ-ONLY REVIEW

**THE NEXT CHAT MUST COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE CHECKLIST BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROTOCOL ACKNOWLEDGMENT (MUST COMPLETE FIRST)

- [ ] Read `TEST_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` completely
- [ ] Read `task-md/TASK-PROTOCOL.md` 
- [ ] Read `task-md/TASKS.md` for active tasks
- [ ] State: "I understand the verification requirements"
- [ ] State: "I will NEVER commit without Madison's YES and date/time"
- [ ] State: "I will ALWAYS ask both verification questions"
- [ ] Confirm current branch with `git branch --show-current`

## üìÅ CRITICAL FILES TO REVIEW

### Task Management Files
- [ ] `task-md/TASKS.md` - Note all active tasks and critical issues
- [ ] `task-md/TASK-PROTOCOL.md` - Understand workflow rules
- [ ] `TEST_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - Understand test failures

### Configuration Files
- [ ] `playwright.config.js` - Note port 4000 configuration (MISMATCH)
- [ ] `vite.config.js` - Note port 8000 configuration
- [ ] `package.json` - Review test scripts and dependencies
- [ ] `.gitignore` - Ensure test artifacts are ignored

### Source Code - Core Components
- [ ] `src/App.jsx` - Main application entry, multiple test dashboards
- [ ] `src/components/EnhancedHelixProjectsShowcase.jsx` - Primary helix component
- [ ] `src/components/TestDashboard.jsx` - Test dashboard 1
- [ ] `src/components/AdvancedTestDashboard.jsx` - Test dashboard 2  
- [ ] `src/components/PlaywrightTestDashboard.jsx` - Test dashboard 3
- [ ] `src/contexts/HelixContext.jsx` - Helix state management

### Test Files - Current State
- [ ] `tests/helix-functionality.spec.js` - Main test suite
- [ ] `tests/specs/functional/helix-core.spec.js` - Core functionality tests
- [ ] `tests/fixtures/baseFixture.js` - Test fixtures
- [ ] `tests/config/test.config.js` - Test configuration
- [ ] `tests/pages/HelixPage.js` - Page object model

### Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] `src/utils/performanceMonitor.js` - Performance tracking
- [ ] `src/components/PerformanceMonitor.jsx` - Visual monitor
- [ ] `src/hooks/useVideoOptimization.js` - Video performance

## üîç GIT STATE VERIFICATION

Run these commands and note the output:
- [ ] `git status` - Note current branch and changes
- [ ] `git log --oneline -5` - Note recent commits
- [ ] `git branch -a` - List all branches
- [ ] `git remote -v` - Verify GitHub remote
- [ ] `npm run dev` - Verify dev server starts on port 8000

## üéØ CRITICAL ISSUES STATUS

### Issue 1: Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Status:** CRITICAL - NOT FIXED
- [ ] Chromium: 100% pass rate (6/6 tests)
- [ ] Firefox: 0% pass rate (0/6 tests) 
- [ ] WebKit: 0% pass rate (0/6 tests)
**Root Cause:** Unknown - needs investigation

### Issue 2: Port Configuration Mismatch
**Status:** HIGH - NOT FIXED
- [ ] Playwright expects port 4000
- [ ] Dev server runs on port 8000
- [ ] May cause test connection failures

### Issue 3: Test Dashboard Redundancy
**Status:** MEDIUM - NOT FIXED
- [ ] Three separate test dashboards active
- [ ] Performance overhead from multiple monitors
- [ ] Needs consolidation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF

1. **Firefox Failures**: Complete test failure, no helix rendering
2. **WebKit Failures**: Similar to Firefox, no network activity
3. **Video Aspect Ratios**: Not maintaining 9:16 ratio properly
4. **Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels, axe-core errors
5. **Memory Growth**: Potential memory leaks during extended scroll

## üìù PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

**NEVER DO THESE:**
- [ ] Commit without Madison saying "YES" + date/time
- [ ] Work on main branch directly
- [ ] Skip updating TASKS.md after phases
- [ ] Make changes outside task scope
- [ ] Ignore browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Ask only one verification question (must ask BOTH)

## üß™ TEST EXECUTION CHECKLIST

Before any changes, run these tests:
- [ ] `npm test` - Run Playwright tests
- [ ] Note which browsers pass/fail
- [ ] Check for port connection errors
- [ ] Document console errors in Firefox/WebKit
- [ ] Save test artifacts for comparison

## ‚úÖ ACKNOWLEDGMENT STATEMENT

After completing this entire audit, state the following:

"I have completed the comprehensive codebase audit. I acknowledge:
1. The critical cross-browser compatibility issues (66% failure rate)
2. Port configuration mismatch between test and dev servers
3. Madison's verification is mandatory before any commit
4. I must update TASKS.md before and after each phase
5. I understand the current test failures and will not make them worse
6. I will test in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit before claiming completion"

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS (AFTER AUDIT)

### Priority 1: Fix Browser Compatibility
1. Debug Firefox rendering issues
2. Debug WebKit JavaScript errors
3. Add browser-specific polyfills
4. Test transforms and animations

### Priority 2: Fix Port Configuration
1. Update playwright.config.js to port 8000
2. Or configure vite to run on port 4000
3. Ensure consistency across all configs

### Priority 3: Consolidate Test Dashboards
1. Map features from all three dashboards
2. Create unified component
3. Archive old implementations
